/* I couldn't find a good default keybind for OSX. Sorry about that. If you have
 * a suggestion, I'd love to hear it.
 * I tend to just use `command+shift+p` and search for _Move File in Group ..._.
 * If you're looking to add your own keybindings, though, the below two commands
 * lines should be about all you need,
 *    { "keys": ["Pick Your Key!"], "command": "move_tab_left" },
 *    { "keys": ["Any Key!"], "command": "move_tab_right" },
